<TITLE>FAA to close 149 regional airport control towers, spare 40 others</TITLE>



<TEXT>

The FAA on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2013-03-22">Friday</TIMEX3> announced it will close 149 regional airport control towers because of forced spending cuts -- sparing 40 others that the FAA had been expected to shutter.

A four-week, phased closure of the 149 control towers will begin on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2013-04-07">April 7</TIMEX3>, the FAA said.

The FAA had been expected to announce the closure of 189 low- or moderate-volume towers staffed by contractors. Before <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2013-03-22">Friday's</TIMEX3> announcement, it said it would consider keeping a tower open if the airport convinces the agency it is in the "national interest" to do so.

By congressional mandate, the FAA must cut nearly $600 million from its nearly $48 billion budget <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2013">this fiscal year</TIMEX3>. Because the majority of its 47,000 employees are air traffic controllers, it is impossible to cut its budget without affecting controllers, the agency says.
